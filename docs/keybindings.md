## Reading Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `o` | Open article in browser, mark as read, and jump to next unread    |
| `O` | Open all unread articles in browser and mark all as read          |
| `y` | Copy article URL to clipboard                                     |

| `E` | Open enclosure (opens command line with enclosure type)           |

---

## Read/Unread Status

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Mark current article as read (and go to next unread article) |
| `R` | Mark **all** articles as read (asks for confirmation) |
| `u` | Mark current article as unread |
| `U` | Mark **all** articles as unread (asks for confirmation) |
| `Alt-r` | Open command line to set read with query (e.g., `:read unread today`) |
| `Alt-u` | Open command line to set unread status (e.g., `:unread marked`) |

**Note**: These commands are context-dependent! In the article list, they act on the *current article* or *all articles* in the list. On the feed list/tree they act on the *current category/feed* or *all categories/feeds*.

**Note**: To mark all articles *above* (and including) the current article as read, press `0 r`; for all articles after (and including) `$ r`. This pattern also works for `u` (unread), `m` (mark), and `v` (unmark).

---
## Marking Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `m` | Mark current article |
| `M` | Mark **all** articles (asks for confirmation) |
| `v` | Unmark current article |
| `V` | Unmark **all** articles (asks for confirmation) |
| `Alt-m` | Open command line to mark articles (e.g., `:mark unread today`) |
| `Alt-v` | Open command line to unmark articles (e.g., `:unmark flagged`) |

## Tags

| ----- | --------                                                                                    |
| `t`   | Open command line to tag article (e.g., `:tag tech`), **TAB** to autocomplete tag names     |
| `T`   | Open command line to untag article (e.g., `:untag tech`), **TAB** to autocomplete tag names |

You can create new tags with `:tagadd urgent red` (press **TAB** for autocomplete colors!). Once created, you can bulk-tag articles: `:tag tech unread` tags all unread articles as `tech`.

---

## Flagging Articles

You can flag (select) articles to execute bulk-operations like read, unread, mark, tag, etc. on them.


| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` | Flag article |
| `F` | Flag **all** articles |
| `d` | Unflag current article (*d*elete flag) |
| `D` | Unflag **all** articles  |
| `i` | Invert flag of current article (*d*elete flag) |
| `I` | Invert flag **all** articles  |
| `Alt-f`/`Alt-d`/`Alt-i` | Open command line with `flag`/`unflag`/`flaginvert` with query (e.g., `:flag unread today`) |


**Note**: These commands only work for article list!

After flagging article, you can bulk-execute any of the above commands on them (`r` for `read`, `m` for `mark`, `t` for `tag`, you get it).

**Note**: To flag all articles *above* and including the current article, press `0 f`; for all articles after `$ f` etc. This also works for `d` and `i`.

## Zen Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `z` | Toggle distraction-free mode (hides all panels except article content) |

---

# Opening Links in Articles with Hints

Eilmeldung shows *hints* for links/images in the article:

![Image showing several link/image hints in the article content display of eilmeldung](images/hints.png)

The "codes" (letters in this case, see setting `hint_type`) before the icons are called *(link) hints*. The following default keybindings are defined for hints:


| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `; ;` | Open a hint in the webbrowser, by entering the hint (see also command `hintfollow`)      |
| `; s` | Share URL of hint: enter a share target and then the hint (see also command `hintshare`) |
| `; y` | Copy URL of hint to clipboard (see also command `hintshare`)                             |

## Article Views

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Show all articles |
| `2` | Show only unread articles |
| `3` | Show only marked articles |

---

## Searching & Filtering

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search articles (type query and press Enter) |
| `n` / `N` | Jump to next / previous match |
| `=` | Open command line to filter articles |
| `+ +` | Apply current filter |
| `+ r` | Clear filter and show all articles |

See [Article Queries](queries.md) for how to craft powerful queries.

**Note**: `=` executes `filter` which is *non-sticky*, i.e., when you change the selected entry in the feed tree, it is not applied automatically. If you want to apply a *sticky* filter, you have to use `filtersticky`, i.e., re-map `=` to `cmd filtersticky`.

---

## Sorting Articles

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `\` | Open command line to set sort order |
| `\| \|` | Reverse current sort order |
| `\| r` | Clear sort order and restore default |

Articles can be sorted by multiple criteria: `feed`, `date`, `synced`, `title`, or `author`. The sort order is displayed in the article list header with an icon (󰌼 for normal, 󰒿 for reversed).

**Examples:**
```
:sort date                    # Sort by date (newest first)
:sort >date                   # Sort by date (oldest first)
:sort feed title              # Sort by feed name, then by title
:sort feed date               # Sort by feed (A-Z), then by date (newest first)
```

For complete sorting documentation, see [Commands](commands.md#sorting-articles).

## Customizing Key Bindings

All key bindings can be customized in your configuration file. See the [Input Configuration](configuration.md#input-configuration) section for details on:

- How to remap existing keys
- How to create multi-key sequences (like `gg`)
- How to bind multiple commands to a single key
- How to unbind keys

**Example custom bindings:**
```toml
[input_config.mappings]
# Vim-style save and quit
"Z Z" = ["confirm quit"]

# Quick tagging
"t i" = ["tag important"]
"t u" = ["tag urgent"]

# Custom navigation
"C-j" = ["pagedown"]
"C-k" = ["pageup"]

# Using modifiers
"C-k" = ["..."] # Ctrl
"M-k" = ["..."] # Meta (Alt)
"S-f1" = ["..."] # Shift and F1
"S-down" = ["..."] # Shift and down arrow key
```

### Understanding Direct Commands vs Command-Line Commands

When creating custom keybindings, it's important to understand the difference between:

- **Direct commands**: Execute immediately with all parameters specified
- **Command-line commands**: Open the command line for interactive input (use `cmd` prefix)

**Example - Opening hints:**
```toml
[input_config.mappings]
# This will NOT work as hintfollow expects an argument
"; f" = ["hintfollow"]

# This works - opens command line to enter hint
"; f" = ["cmd hintfollow"]

# This also works if you know the hint in advance
"; f" = ["hintfollow a"]
```

**Example - Filtering articles:**
```toml
# Opens command line to type filter query
"=" = ["cmd filter"]

# Applies specific filter immediately
"=" = ["filter unread today"]
```

**When to use `cmd`:**
- Commands expecting user input: `hintfollow`, `hintshare`, `tag`, `filter`, `sort`, `rename`
- When you want Tab completion for suggestions
- When you want to see/edit before executing

**When NOT to use `cmd`:**
- Commands that work standalone: `sync`, `quit`, `zen`, `read`, `mark`
- Multi-command sequences: `["open", "read", "nextunread"]`

See [Commands Reference](commands.md#using-commands-in-key-bindings) for more details.

---

See the [default configuration](../examples/default-config.toml) for the complete list of default key bindings.

## Mouse Support

Mouse support is disabled by default. Enable it by `mouse_support = true`:
- selection by a mouse click is supported in the feed and article list
- rudimentary scrolling support in the article list and the article content
- drag the border between the articles and the content to resize (note that this overrides layout settings from the config file)
